# Smartbin
In this project, we made a smart dustbin which will send out alerts whenever the dustbin is about to get full. It will notify the authorities of the same and thus would help them collect it on time. Using the power of Internet of Things (IOT), Smart Bin is designed for efficient and smart waste monitoring. The Smart Bin uses ultrasonic sensors to monitor the height of garbage in any dustbin. Ultrasonic sensors are placed on the interior side of the lid of each dustbin.
